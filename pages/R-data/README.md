## 1 Introduction

Reading data into a statistical system for analysis and exporting the
results to some other system for report writing can be frustrating tasks
that can take far more time than the statistical analysis itself, even
though most readers will find the latter far more appealing.

This manual describes the import and export facilities available either
in R itself or via packages which are available from CRAN or elsewhere.

Unless otherwise stated, everything described in this manual is (at
least in principle) available on all platforms running R.

In general, statistical systems like R are not particularly well suited
to manipulations of large-scale data. Some other systems are better than
R at this, and part of the thrust of this manual is to suggest that
rather than duplicating functionality in R we can make another system do
the work! (For example Therneau & Grambsch (2000) commented that they
preferred to do data manipulation in SAS and then use package
[**survival**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=survival) in S for the
analysis.) Database manipulation systems are often very suitable for
manipulating and extracting data: several packages to interact with
DBMSs are discussed here.

There are packages to allow functionality developed in languages such as
`Java`, `perl` and `python` to be directly integrated with R code,
making the use of facilities in these languages even more appropriate.
(See the [**rJava**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rJava) package
from CRAN and the **SJava**, **RSPerl** and **RSPython** packages from
the Omegahat project, <http://www.omegahat.net>.)

It is also worth remembering that R like S comes from the Unix tradition
of small re-usable tools, and it can be rewarding to use tools such as
`awk` and `perl` to manipulate data before import or after export. The
case study in Becker, Chambers & Wilks (1988, Chapter 9) is an example
of this, where Unix tools were used to check and manipulate the data
before input to S. The traditional Unix tools are now much more widely
available, including for Windows.

This manual was first written in 2000, and the number of scope of R
packages has increased a hundredfold since. For specialist data formats
it is worth searching to see if a suitable package already exists.

### 1.1 Imports

The easiest form of data to import into R is a simple text file, and
this will often be acceptable for problems of small or medium scale. The
primary function to import from a text file is `scan`, and this
underlies most of the more convenient functions discussed in
[Spreadsheet-like data](#Spreadsheet_002dlike-data).

However, all statistical consultants are familiar with being presented
by a client with a memory stick (formerly, a floppy disc or CD-R) of
data in some proprietary binary format, for example 'an Excel
spreadsheet' or 'an SPSS file'. Often the simplest thing to do is to use
the originating application to export the data as a text file (and
statistical consultants will have copies of the most common applications
on their computers for that purpose). However, this is not always
possible, and [Importing from other statistical systems](#Importing-from-other-statistical-systems) discusses what
facilities are available to access such files directly from R. For Excel
spreadsheets, the available methods are summarized in [Reading Excel spreadsheets](#Reading-Excel-spreadsheets).

In a few cases, data have been stored in a binary form for compactness
and speed of access. One application of this that we have seen several
times is imaging data, which is normally stored as a stream of bytes as
represented in memory, possibly preceded by a header. Such data formats
are discussed in [Binary files](#Binary-files) and [Binary connections](#Binary-connections).

For much larger databases it is common to handle the data using a
database management system (DBMS). There is once again the option of
using the DBMS to extract a plain file, but for many such DBMSs the
extraction operation can be done directly from an R package: See
[Relational databases](#Relational-databases). Importing data via
network connections is discussed in [Network interfaces](#Network-interfaces).

#### 1.1.1 Encodings

Unless the file to be imported from is entirely in ASCII, it is usually
necessary to know how it was encoded. For text files, a good way to find
out something about its structure is the `file` command-line tool (for
Windows, included in `Rtools`). This reports something like

```r
text.Rd: UTF-8 Unicode English text
text2.dat: ISO-8859 English text
text3.dat: Little-endian UTF-16 Unicode English character data,
   with CRLF line terminators
intro.dat: UTF-8 Unicode text
intro.dat: UTF-8 Unicode (with BOM) text
```

Modern Unix-alike systems, including macOS, are likely to produce UTF-8
files. Windows may produce what it calls 'Unicode' files (`UCS-2LE` or
just possibly `UTF-16LE`[^1^](#FOOT1)). Otherwise most files
will be in a 8-bit encoding unless from a Chinese/Japanese/Korean locale
(which have a wide range of encodings in common use). It is not possible
to automatically detect with certainty which 8-bit encoding (although
guesses may be possible and `file` may guess as it did in the example
above), so you may simply have to ask the originator for some clues
(e.g. 'Russian on Windows').

'BOMs' (Byte Order Marks,
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_order_mark>) cause problems for
Unicode files. In the Unix world BOMs are rarely used, whereas in the
Windows world they almost always are for UCS-2/UTF-16 files, and often
are for UTF-8 files. The `file` utility will not even recognize UCS-2
files without a BOM, but many other utilities will refuse to read files
with a BOM and the IANA standards for `UTF-16LE` and `UTF-16BE` prohibit
it. We have too often been reduced to looking at the file with the
command-line utility `od` or a hex editor to work out its encoding.

Note that `utf8` is not a valid encoding name (`UTF-8` is), and
`macintosh` is the most portable name for what is sometimes called 'Mac
Roman' encoding.

### 1.2 Export to text files

Exporting results from R is usually a less contentious task, but there
are still a number of pitfalls. There will be a target application in
mind, and often a text file will be the most convenient interchange
vehicle. (If a binary file is required, see [Binary files](#Binary-files).)

Function `cat` underlies the functions for exporting data. It takes a
`file` argument, and the `append` argument allows a text file to be
written via successive calls to `cat`. Better, especially if this is to
be done many times, is to open a `file` connection for writing or
appending, and `cat` to that connection, then `close` it.

The most common task is to write a matrix or data frame to file as a
rectangular grid of numbers, possibly with row and column labels. This
can be done by the functions `write.table` and `write`. Function `write`
just writes out a matrix or vector in a specified number of columns (and
transposes a matrix). Function `write.table` is more convenient, and
writes out a data frame (or an object that can be coerced to a data
frame) with row and column labels.

There are a number of issues that need to be considered in writing out a
data frame to a text file.

1.  **Precision**


    Most of the conversions of real/complex numbers done by these
    functions is to full precision, but those by `write` are governed by
    the current setting of `options(digits)`. For more control, use
    `format` on a data frame, possibly column-by-column.

2.  **Header line**

    R prefers the header line to have no entry for the row names, so the
    file looks like


    ```r
                    dist    climb   time
    Greenmantle     2.5     650     16.083
       ...
    ```


    Some other systems require a (possibly empty) entry for the row
    names, which is what `write.table` will provide if argument
    `col.names = NA` is specified. Excel is one such system.

3.  **Separator**


    A common field separator to use in the file is a comma, as that is
    unlikely to appear in any of the fields in English-speaking
    countries. Such files are known as CSV (comma separated values)
    files, and wrapper function `write.csv` provides appropriate
    defaults. In some locales the comma is used as the decimal point
    (set this in `write.table` by `dec = ","`) and there CSV files use
    the semicolon as the field separator: use `write.csv2` for
    appropriate defaults. There is an IETF standard for CSV files (which
    mandates commas and CRLF line endings, for which use
    `eol = "\r\n"`), RFC4180 (see
    <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180>), but what is more important
    in practice is that the file is readable by the application it is
    targeted at.

    Using a semicolon or tab (`sep = "\t"`) are probably the safest
    options.

4.  **Missing values**

    By default missing values are output as `NA`, but this may be
    changed by argument `na`. Note that `NaN`s are treated as `NA` by
    `write.table`, but not by `cat` nor `write`.

5.  **Quoting strings**

    By default strings are quoted (including the row and column names).
    Argument `quote` controls if character and factor variables are
    quoted: some programs, for example **Mondrian**
    (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mondrian_(software)>), do not accept
    quoted strings.

    Some care is needed if the strings contain embedded quotes. Three
    useful forms are


    ```r
    > df <- data.frame(a = I("a \" quote"))
    > write.table(df)
    "a"
    "1" "a \" quote"
    > write.table(df, qmethod = "double")
    "a"
    "1" "a "" quote"
    > write.table(df, quote = FALSE, sep = ",")
    a
    1,a " quote
    ```


    The second is the form of escape commonly used by spreadsheets.

6.  **Encodings**

    Text files do not contain metadata on their encodings, so for
    non-ASCII data the file needs to be targetted to the application
    intended to read it. All of these functions can write to a
    _connection_ which allows an encoding to be specified for the file,
    and `write.table` has a `fileEncoding` argument to make this easier.

    The hard part is to know what file encoding to use. For use on
    Windows, it is best to use what Windows calls
    'Unicode'[^2^](#FOOT2), that is `"UTF-16LE"`. Using UTF-8 is
    a good way to make portable files that will not easily be confused
    with any other encoding, but even macOS applications (where UTF-8 is
    the system encoding) may not recognize them, and Windows
    applications are most unlikely to. Apparently Excel:mac 2004/8
    expected `.csv` files in `"macroman"` encoding (the encoding used in
    much earlier versions of Mac OS).

Function `write.matrix` in package
[**MASS**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=MASS) provides a
specialized interface for writing matrices, with the option of writing
them in blocks and thereby reducing memory usage.

It is possible to use `sink` to divert the standard R output to a file,
and thereby capture the output of (possibly implicit) `print`
statements. This is not usually the most efficient route, and the
`options(width)` setting may need to be increased.

Function `write.foreign` in package
[**foreign**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=foreign) uses
`write.table` to produce a text file and also writes a code file that
will read this text file into another statistical package. There is
currently support for export to `SAS`, `SPSS` and `Stata`.

---

### 1.3 XML

When reading data from text files, it is the responsibility of the user
to know and to specify the conventions used to create that file, e.g.
the comment character, whether a header line is present, the value
separator, the representation for missing values (and so on) described
in [Export to text files](#Export-to-text-files). A markup language
which can be used to describe not only content but also the structure of
the content can make a file self-describing, so that one need not
provide these details to the software reading the data.

The eXtensible Markup Language -- more commonly known simply as XML --
can be used to provide such structure, not only for standard datasets
but also more complex data structures. XML is becoming extremely popular
and is emerging as a standard for general data markup and exchange. It
is being used by different communities to describe geographical data
such as maps, graphical displays, mathematics and so on.

XML provides a way to specify the file's encoding, e.g.

```r
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
```

although it does not require it.

The [**XML**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=XML) package provides
general facilities for reading and writing XML documents within R.
Package [**StatDataML**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=StatDataML)
on CRAN is one example building on
[**XML**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=XML). Another interface to
the **libxml2** C library is provided by package
[**xml2**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=xml2).

yaml is another system for structuring text data, with emphasis on
human-readability: it is supported by package
[**yaml**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=yaml).

---

In [Export to text files](#Export-to-text-files) we saw a number of
variations on the format of a spreadsheet-like text file, in which the
data are presented in a rectangular grid, possibly with row and column
labels. In this section we consider importing such files into R.

---

### 2.1 Variations on `read.table`

The function `read.table` is the most convenient way to read in a
rectangular grid of data. Because of the many possibilities, there are
several other functions that call `read.table` but change a group of
default arguments.

Beware that `read.table` is an inefficient way to read in very large
numerical matrices: see `scan` below.

Some of the issues to consider are:

1.  **Encoding**

    If the file contains non-ASCII character fields, ensure that it is
    read in the correct encoding. This is mainly an issue for reading
    Latin-1 files in a UTF-8 locale, which can be done by something like


    ```r
    read.table("file.dat", fileEncoding="latin1")
    ```


    Note that this will work in any locale which can represent Latin-1
    strings, but not many Greek/Russian/Chinese/Japanese ... locales.

2.  **Header line**

    We recommend that you specify the `header` argument explicitly,
    Conventionally the header line has entries only for the columns and
    not for the row labels, so is one field shorter than the remaining
    lines. (If R sees this, it sets `header = TRUE`.) If presented with
    a file that has a (possibly empty) header field for the row labels,
    read it in by something like


    ```r
    read.table("file.dat", header = TRUE, row.names = 1)
    ```


    Column names can be given explicitly via the `col.names`; explicit
    names override the header line (if present).

3.  **Separator**

    Normally looking at the file will determine the field separator to
    be used, but with white-space separated files there may be a choice
    between the default `sep = ""` which uses any white space (spaces,
    tabs or newlines) as a separator, `sep = " "` and `sep = "\t"`. Note
    that the choice of separator affects the input of quoted strings.

    If you have a tab-delimited file containing empty fields be sure to
    use `sep = "\t"`.

4.  **Quoting**

    By default character strings can be quoted by either '`"`'
    or '`'`', and in each case all the characters up to a
    matching quote are taken as part of the character string. The set of
    valid quoting characters (which might be none) is controlled by the
    `quote` argument. For `sep = "\n"` the default is changed to
    `quote = ""`.

    If no separator character is specified, quotes can be escaped within
    quoted strings by immediately preceding them by '`\`',
    C-style.

    If a separator character is specified, quotes can be escaped within
    quoted strings by doubling them as is conventional in spreadsheets.
    For example


    ```r
    'One string isn''t two',"one more"
    ```


    can be read by



    ```r
    read.table("testfile", sep = ",")
    ```


    This does not work with the default separator.

5.  **Missing values**

    By default the file is assumed to contain the character string `NA`
    to represent missing values, but this can be changed by the argument
    `na.strings`, which is a vector of one or more character
    representations of missing values.

    Empty fields in numeric columns are also regarded as missing values.

    In numeric columns, the values `NaN`, `Inf` and `-Inf` are accepted.

6.  **Unfilled lines**

    It is quite common for a file exported from a spreadsheet to have
    all trailing empty fields (and their separators) omitted. To read
    such files set `fill = TRUE`.

7.  **White space in character fields**

    If a separator is specified, leading and trailing white space in
    character fields is regarded as part of the field. To strip the
    space, use argument `strip.white = TRUE`.

8.  **Blank lines**

    By default, `read.table` ignores empty lines. This can be changed by
    setting `blank.lines.skip = FALSE`, which will only be useful in
    conjunction with `fill = TRUE`, perhaps to use blank rows to
    indicate missing cases in a regular layout.

9.  **Classes for the variables**

    Unless you take any special action, `read.table` reads all the
    columns as character vectors and then tries to select a suitable
    class for each variable in the data frame. It tries in turn
    `logical`, `integer`, `numeric` and `complex`, moving on if any
    entry is not missing and cannot be converted.[^3^](#FOOT3)
    If all of these fail, the variable is converted to a factor.

    Arguments `colClasses` and `as.is` provide greater control.
    Specifying `as.is = TRUE` suppresses conversion of character vectors
    to factors (only). Using `colClasses` allows the desired class to be
    set for each column in the input: it will be faster and use less
    memory.

    Note that `colClasses` and `as.is` are specified _per_ column, not
    _per_ variable, and so include the column of row names (if any).

10. **Comments**

    By default, `read.table` uses '`#`' as a comment character,
    and if this is encountered (except in quoted strings) the rest of
    the line is ignored. Lines containing only white space and a comment
    are treated as blank lines.

    If it is known that there will be no comments in the data file, it
    is safer (and may be faster) to use `comment.char = ""`.

11. **Escapes**

    Many OSes have conventions for using backslash as an escape
    character in text files, but Windows does not (and uses backslash in
    path names). It is optional in R whether such conventions are
    applied to data files.

    Both `read.table` and `scan` have a logical argument `allowEscapes`.
    This is false by default, and backslashes are then only interpreted
    as (under circumstances described above) escaping quotes. If this
    set to be true, C-style escapes are interpreted, namely the control
    characters `\a, \b, \f, \n, \r, \t, \v` and octal and hexadecimal
    representations like `\040` and `\0x2A`. Any other escaped character
    is treated as itself, including backslash. Note that Unicode escapes
    such as `\uxxxx` are never interpreted.

12. **Encoding**

    This can be specified by the `fileEncoding` argument, for example


    ```r
    fileEncoding = "UCS-2LE"    # Windows ‘Unicode’ files
    fileEncoding = "UTF-8"
    ```


    If you know (correctly) the file's encoding this will almost always
    work. However, we know of one exception, UTF-8 files with a BOM.
    Some people claim that UTF-8 files should never have a BOM, but some
    software (apparently including Excel:mac) uses them, and many
    Unix-alike OSes do not accept them. So faced with a file which
    `file` reports as



    ```r
    intro.dat: UTF-8 Unicode (with BOM) text
    ```


    it can be read on Windows by



    ```r
    read.table("intro.dat", fileEncoding = "UTF-8")
    ```


    but on a Unix-alike might need



    ```r
    read.table("intro.dat", fileEncoding = "UTF-8-BOM")
    ```


    (This would most likely work without specifying an encoding in a
    UTF-8 locale.)

Convenience functions `read.csv` and `read.delim` provide arguments to
`read.table` appropriate for CSV and tab-delimited files exported from
spreadsheets in English-speaking locales. The variations `read.csv2` and
`read.delim2` are appropriate for use in those locales where the comma
is used for the decimal point and (for `read.csv2`) for spreadsheets
which use semicolons to separate fields.

If the options to `read.table` are specified incorrectly, the error
message will usually be of the form

```r
Error in scan(file = file, what = what, sep = sep, :
        line 1 did not have 5 elements
```

or

```r
Error in read.table("files.dat", header = TRUE) :
        more columns than column names
```

This may give enough information to find the problem, but the auxiliary
function `count.fields` can be useful to investigate further.

Efficiency can be important when reading large data grids. It will help
to specify `comment.char = ""`, `colClasses` as one of the atomic vector
types (logical, integer, numeric, complex, character or perhaps raw) for
each column, and to give `nrows`, the number of rows to be read (and a
mild over-estimate is better than not specifying this at all). See the
examples in later sections.

---

### 2.2 Fixed-width-format files

Sometimes data files have no field delimiters but have fields in
pre-specified columns. This was very common in the days of punched
cards, and is still sometimes used to save file space.

Function `read.fwf` provides a simple way to read such files, specifying
a vector of field widths. The function reads the file into memory as
whole lines, splits the resulting character strings, writes out a
temporary tab-separated file and then calls `read.table`. This is
adequate for small files, but for anything more complicated we recommend
using the facilities of a language like `perl` to pre-process the file.

Function `read.fortran` is a similar function for fixed-format files,
using Fortran-style column specifications.

---

### 2.3 Data Interchange Format (DIF)

An old format sometimes used for spreadsheet-like data is DIF, or Data
Interchange format.

Function `read.DIF` provides a simple way to read such files. It takes
arguments similar to `read.table` for assigning types to each of the
columns.

On Windows, spreadsheet programs often store spreadsheet data copied to
the clipboard in this format; `read.DIF("clipboard")` can read it from
there directly. It is slightly more robust than
`read.table("clipboard")` in handling spreadsheets with empty cells.

---

### 2.4 Using `scan` directly

Both `read.table` and `read.fwf` use `scan` to read the file, and then
process the results of `scan`. They are very convenient, but sometimes
it is better to use `scan` directly.

Function `scan` has many arguments, most of which we have already
covered under `read.table`. The most crucial argument is `what`, which
specifies a list of modes of variables to be read from the file. If the
list is named, the names are used for the components of the returned
list. Modes can be numeric, character or complex, and are usually
specified by an example, e.g. `0`, `""` or `0i`. For example

```r
cat("2 3 5 7", "11 13 17 19", file="ex.dat", sep="\n")
scan(file="ex.dat", what=list(x=0, y="", z=0), flush=TRUE)
```

returns a list with three components and discards the fourth column in
the file.

There is a function `readLines` which will be more convenient if all you
want is to read whole lines into R for further processing.

One common use of `scan` is to read in a large matrix. Suppose file
`matrix.dat` just contains the numbers for a 200 x 2000 matrix.
Then we can use

```r
A <- matrix(scan("matrix.dat", n = 200*2000), 200, 2000, byrow = TRUE)
```

On one test this took 1 second (under Linux, 3 seconds under Windows on
the same machine) whereas

```r
A <- as.matrix(read.table("matrix.dat"))
```

took 10 seconds (and more memory), and

```r
A <- as.matrix(read.table("matrix.dat", header = FALSE, nrows = 200,
                          comment.char = "", colClasses = "numeric"))
```

took 7 seconds. The difference is almost entirely due to the overhead of
reading 2000 separate short columns: were they of length 2000, `scan`
took 9 seconds whereas `read.table` took 18 if used efficiently (in
particular, specifying `colClasses`) and 125 if used naively.

Note that timings can depend on the type read and the data. Consider
reading a million distinct integers:

```r
writeLines(as.character((1+1e6):2e6), "ints.dat")
xi <- scan("ints.dat", what=integer(0), n=1e6)   # 0.77s
xn <- scan("ints.dat", what=numeric(0), n=1e6)   # 0.93s
xc <- scan("ints.dat", what=character(0), n=1e6) # 0.85s
xf <- as.factor(xc)                              # 2.2s
DF <- read.table("ints.dat")                     # 4.5s
```

and a million examples of a small set of codes:

```r
code <- c("LMH", "SJC", "CHCH", "SPC", "SOM")
writeLines(sample(code, 1e6, replace=TRUE), "code.dat")
y <- scan("code.dat", what=character(0), n=1e6)  # 0.44s
yf <- as.factor(y)                               # 0.21s
DF <- read.table("code.dat")                     # 4.9s
DF <- read.table("code.dat", nrows=1e6)          # 3.6s
```

Note that these timings depend heavily on the operating system (the
basic reads in Windows take at least as twice as long as these Linux
times) and on the precise state of the garbage collector.

---

### 2.5 Re-shaping data

Sometimes spreadsheet data is in a compact format that gives the
covariates for each subject followed by all the observations on that
subject. R's modelling functions need observations in a single column.
Consider the following sample of data from repeated MRI brain
measurements

```r
 Status   Age    V1     V2     V3    V4
      P 23646 45190  50333  55166 56271
     CC 26174 35535  38227  37911 41184
     CC 27723 25691  25712  26144 26398
     CC 27193 30949  29693  29754 30772
     CC 24370 50542  51966  54341 54273
     CC 28359 58591  58803  59435 61292
     CC 25136 45801  45389  47197 47126
```

There are two covariates and up to four measurements on each subject.
The data were exported from Excel as a file `mr.csv`.

We can use `stack` to help manipulate these data to give a single
response.

```r
zz <- read.csv("mr.csv", strip.white = TRUE)
zzz <- cbind(zz[gl(nrow(zz), 1, 4*nrow(zz)), 1:2], stack(zz[, 3:6]))
```

with result

```r
      Status   Age values ind
X1         P 23646  45190  V1
X2        CC 26174  35535  V1
X3        CC 27723  25691  V1
X4        CC 27193  30949  V1
X5        CC 24370  50542  V1
X6        CC 28359  58591  V1
X7        CC 25136  45801  V1
X11        P 23646  50333  V2
...
```

Function `unstack` goes in the opposite direction, and may be useful for
exporting data.

Another way to do this is to use the function `reshape`, by

```r
> reshape(zz, idvar="id",timevar="var",
  varying=list(c("V1","V2","V3","V4")),direction="long")
    Status   Age var    V1 id
1.1      P 23646   1 45190  1
2.1     CC 26174   1 35535  2
3.1     CC 27723   1 25691  3
4.1     CC 27193   1 30949  4
5.1     CC 24370   1 50542  5
6.1     CC 28359   1 58591  6
7.1     CC 25136   1 45801  7
1.2      P 23646   2 50333  1
2.2     CC 26174   2 38227  2
...
```

The `reshape` function has a more complicated syntax than `stack` but
can be used for data where the 'long' form has more than the one column
in this example. With `direction="wide"`, `reshape` can also perform the
opposite transformation.

Some people prefer the tools in packages
[**reshape**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=reshape),
[**reshape2**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=reshape2) and
[**plyr**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=plyr).

### 2.6 Flat contingency tables

Displaying higher-dimensional contingency tables in array form typically
is rather inconvenient. In categorical data analysis, such information
is often represented in the form of bordered two-dimensional arrays with
leading rows and columns specifying the combination of factor levels
corresponding to the cell counts. These rows and columns are typically
"ragged" in the sense that labels are only displayed when they change,
with the obvious convention that rows are read from top to bottom and
columns are read from left to right. In R, such "flat" contingency
tables can be created using `ftable`, which creates
objects of class `"ftable"` with an appropriate print method.

As a simple example, consider the R standard data set `UCBAdmissions`
which is a 3-dimensional contingency table resulting from classifying
applicants to graduate school at UC Berkeley for the six largest
departments in 1973 classified by admission and sex.

```r
> data(UCBAdmissions)
> ftable(UCBAdmissions)
                Dept   A   B   C   D   E   F
Admit    Gender
Admitted Male        512 353 120 138  53  22
         Female       89  17 202 131  94  24
Rejected Male        313 207 205 279 138 351
         Female       19   8 391 244 299 317
```

The printed representation is clearly more useful than displaying the
data as a 3-dimensional array.

There is also a function `read.ftable` for reading in flat-like
contingency tables from files. This has
additional arguments for dealing with variants on how exactly the
information on row and column variables names and levels is represented.
The help page for `read.ftable` has some useful examples. The flat
tables can be converted to standard contingency tables in array form
using `as.table`.

Note that flat tables are characterized by their "ragged" display of row
(and maybe also column) labels. If the full grid of levels of the row
variables is given, one should instead use `read.table` to read in the
data, and create the contingency table from this using `xtabs`.

## 3 Importing from other statistical systems

In this chapter we consider the problem of reading a binary data file
written by another statistical system. This is often best avoided, but
may be unavoidable if the originating system is not available.

In all cases the facilities described were written for data files from
specific versions of the other system (often in the early 2000s), and
have not necessarily been updated for the most recent versions of the
other system.

 • [Octave](#Octave)

---

---

### 3.1 EpiInfo, Minitab, S-PLUS, SAS, SPSS, Stata, Systat

The recommended package
[**foreign**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=foreign) provides
import facilities for files produced by these statistical systems, and
for export to Stata. In some cases these functions may require
substantially less memory than `read.table` would. `write.foreign` (See
[Export to text files](#Export-to-text-files)) provides an export
mechanism with support currently for `SAS`, `SPSS` and `Stata`.

EpiInfo versions 5 and 6 stored data in a self-describing fixed-width
text format. `read.epiinfo` will read these `.REC` files into
an R data frame. EpiData also produces data in this format.

Function `read.mtp` imports a 'Minitab Portable Worksheet'. This returns
the components of the worksheet as an R list.

Function `read.xport` reads a file in SAS Transport (XPORT) format and
return a list of data frames. If SAS is available on your system,
function `read.ssd` can be used to create and run a SAS script that
saves a SAS permanent dataset (`.ssd` or `.sas7bdat`)
in Transport format. It then calls `read.xport` to read the resulting
file. (Package [**Hmisc**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Hmisc) has
a similar function `sas.get`, also running SAS.) For those without
access to SAS but running on Windows, the SAS System Viewer (a zero-cost
download) can be used to open SAS datasets and export them to e.g.
`.csv` format.

Function `read.S` which can read binary objects produced by S-PLUS 3.x,
4.x or 2000 on (32-bit) Unix or Windows (and can read them on a
different OS). This is able to read many but not all S objects: in
particular it can read vectors, matrices and data frames and lists
containing those.

Function `data.restore` reads S-PLUS data dumps (created by `data.dump`)
with the same restrictions (except that dumps from the Alpha platform
can also be read). It should be possible to read data dumps from S-PLUS
5.x and later written with `data.dump(oldStyle=T)`.

If you have access to S-PLUS, it is usually more reliable to `dump` the
object(s) in S-PLUS and `source` the dump file in R. For S-PLUS 5.x and
later you may need to use `dump(..., oldStyle=T)`, and to read in very
large objects it may be preferable to use the dump file as a batch
script rather than use the `source` function.

Function `read.spss` can read files created by the 'save' and 'export'
commands in SPSS. It returns a list with one component for each variable
in the saved data set. SPSS variables with value labels are optionally
converted to R factors.

SPSS Data Entry is an application for creating data entry forms. By
default it creates data files with extra formatting information that
`read.spss` cannot handle, but it is possible to export the data in an
ordinary SPSS format.

Some third-party applications claim to produce data 'in SPSS format' but
with differences in the formats: `read.spss` may or may not be able to
handle these.

Stata `.dta` files are a binary file format. Files from
versions 5 up to 12 of Stata can be read and written by functions
`read.dta` and `write.dta`. Stata variables with value labels are
optionally converted to (and from) R factors. For Stata versions 13 and
later see CRAN packages
[**readstata13**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=readstata13) and
[**haven**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=haven).

`read.systat` reads those Systat `SAVE` files that are rectangular data
files (`mtype = 1`) written on little-endian machines (such as from
Windows). These have extension `.sys` or (more recently)
`.syd`.

---

### 3.2 Octave

Octave is a numerical linear algebra system (<http://www.octave.org>),
and function `read.octave` in package
[**foreign**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=foreign) can read in
files in Octave text data format created using the Octave command
`save -ascii`, with support for most of the common types of variables,
including the standard atomic (real and complex scalars, matrices, and
_N_-d arrays, strings, ranges, and boolean scalars and matrices) and
recursive (structs, cells, and lists) ones.

## 4 Relational databases

 • [Overview of RDBMSs](#Overview-of-RDBMSs)     
 • [R interface packages](#R-interface-packages)

---

---

### 4.1 Why use a database?

There are limitations on the types of data that R handles well. Since
all data being manipulated by R are resident in memory, and several
copies of the data can be created during execution of a function, R is
not well suited to extremely large data sets. Data objects that are more
than a (few) hundred megabytes in size can cause R to run out of memory,
particularly on a 32-bit operating system.

R does not easily support concurrent access to data. That is, if more
than one user is accessing, and perhaps updating, the same data, the
changes made by one user will not be visible to the others.

R does support persistence of data, in that you can save a data object
or an entire worksheet from one session and restore it at the subsequent
session, but the format of the stored data is specific to R and not
easily manipulated by other systems.

Database management systems (DBMSs) and, in particular, relational DBMSs
(RDBMSs) _are_ designed to do all of these things well. Their strengths
are

1.  To provide fast access to selected parts of large databases.
2.  Powerful ways to summarize and cross-tabulate columns in databases.
3.  Store data in more organized ways than the rectangular grid model of
    spreadsheets and R data frames.
4.  Concurrent access from multiple clients running on multiple hosts
    while enforcing security constraints on access to the data.
5.  Ability to act as a server to a wide range of clients.

The sort of statistical applications for which DBMS might be used are to
extract a 10% sample of the data, to cross-tabulate data to produce a
multi-dimensional contingency table, and to extract data group by group
from a database for separate analysis.

Increasingly OSes are themselves making use of DBMSs for these reasons,
so it is nowadays likely that one will be already installed on your
(non-Windows) OS. [Akonadi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akonadi) is
used by KDE4 to store personal information. Several macOS applications,
including Mail and Address Book, use SQLite.

---

### 4.2 Overview of RDBMSs

Traditionally there had been large (and expensive) commercial RDBMSs
([Informix](http://www.informix.com); [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com);
[Sybase](http://www.sybase.com); [IBM's DB2](http://www.ibm.com/db2);
[Microsoft SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/SQL/default.mspx) on
Windows) and academic and small-system databases (such as
MySQL[^4^](#FOOT4), PostgreSQL, Microsoft Access, ...), the
former marked out by much greater emphasis on data security features.
The line is blurring, with MySQL and PostgreSQL having more and more
high-end features, and free 'express' versions being made available for
the commercial DBMSs.

There are other commonly used data sources, including spreadsheets,
non-relational databases and even text files (possibly compressed). Open
Database Connectivity (ODBC) is a standard to use all of these data
sources. It originated on Windows (see
<https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms710252%28v=vs.85%29.aspx>)
but is also implemented on Linux/Unix/macOS.

All of the packages described later in this chapter provide clients to
client/server databases. The database can reside on the same machine or
(more often) remotely. There is an ISO standard (in fact several: SQL92
is ISO/IEC 9075, also known as ANSI X3.135-1992, and SQL99 is coming
into use) for an interface language called SQL (Structured Query
Language, sometimes pronounced 'sequel': see Bowman _et al._ 1996 and
Kline and Kline 2001) which these DBMSs support to varying degrees.

#### 4.2.1 SQL queries

The more comprehensive R interfaces generate SQL behind the scenes for
common operations, but direct use of SQL is needed for complex
operations in all. Conventionally SQL is written in upper case, but many
users will find it more convenient to use lower case in the R interface
functions.

A relational DBMS stores data as a database of _tables_ (or _relations_)
which are rather similar to R data frames, in that they are made up of
_columns_ or _fields_ of one type (numeric, character, date, currency,
...) and _rows_ or _records_ containing the observations for one entity.

SQL 'queries' are quite general operations on a relational database. The
classical query is a SELECT statement of the type

```r
SELECT State, Murder FROM USArrests WHERE Rape > 30 ORDER BY Murder

SELECT t.sch, c.meanses, t.sex, t.achieve
  FROM student as t, school as c WHERE t.sch = c.id

SELECT sex, COUNT(*) FROM student GROUP BY sex

SELECT sch, AVG(sestat) FROM student GROUP BY sch LIMIT 10
```

The first of these selects two columns from the R data frame `USArrests`
that has been copied across to a database table, subsets on a third
column and asks the results be sorted. The second performs a database
_join_ on two tables `student` and `school` and returns four columns.
The third and fourth queries do some cross-tabulation and return counts
or averages. (The five aggregation functions are COUNT(\*) and SUM, MAX,
MIN and AVG, each applied to a single column.)

SELECT queries use FROM to select the table, WHERE to specify a
condition for inclusion (or more than one condition separated by AND or
OR), and ORDER BY to sort the result. Unlike data frames, rows in RDBMS
tables are best thought of as unordered, and without an ORDER BY
statement the ordering is indeterminate. You can sort (in
lexicographical order) on more than one column by separating them by
commas. Placing DESC after an ORDER BY puts the sort in descending
order.

SELECT DISTINCT queries will only return one copy of each distinct row
in the selected table.

The GROUP BY clause selects subgroups of the rows according to the
criterion. If more than one column is specified (separated by commas)
then multi-way cross-classifications can be summarized by one of the
five aggregation functions. A HAVING clause allows the select to include
or exclude groups depending on the aggregated value.

If the SELECT statement contains an ORDER BY statement that produces a
unique ordering, a LIMIT clause can be added to select (by number) a
contiguous block of output rows. This can be useful to retrieve rows a
block at a time. (It may not be reliable unless the ordering is unique,
as the LIMIT clause can be used to optimize the query.)

There are queries to create a table (CREATE TABLE, but usually one
copies a data frame to the database in these interfaces), INSERT or
DELETE or UPDATE data. A table is destroyed by a DROP TABLE 'query'.

Kline and Kline (2001) discuss the details of the implementation of SQL
in Microsoft SQL Server 2000, Oracle, MySQL and PostgreSQL.

---

#### 4.2.2 Data types

Data can be stored in a database in various data types. The range of
data types is DBMS-specific, but the SQL standard defines many types,
including the following that are widely implemented (often not by the
SQL name).

`float(p)`

: Real number, with optional precision. Often called `real` or
`double` or `double precision`.

`integer`

: 32-bit integer. Often called `int`.

`smallint`

: 16-bit integer

`character(n)`

: fixed-length character string. Often called `char`.

`character varying(n)`

: variable-length character string. Often called `varchar`. Almost
always has a limit of 255 chars.

`boolean`

: true or false. Sometimes called `bool` or `bit`.

`date`

: calendar date

`time`

: time of day

`timestamp`

: date and time

There are variants on `time` and `timestamp`, `with timezone`. Other
types widely implemented are `text` and `blob`, for large blocks of text
and binary data, respectively.

The more comprehensive of the R interface packages hide the type
conversion issues from the user.

---

### 4.3 R interface packages

There are several packages available on CRAN to help R communicate with
DBMSs. They provide different levels of abstraction. Some provide means
to copy whole data frames to and from databases. All have functions to
select data within the database via SQL queries, and to retrieve the
result as a whole as a data frame or in pieces (usually as groups of
rows).

All except [**RODBC**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RODBC) are
tied to one DBMS, but there has been a proposal for a unified
'front-end' package [**DBI**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=DBI)
(<https://developer.r-project.org/db>) in conjunction with a 'back-end',
the most developed of which is
[**RMySQL**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RMySQL). Also on CRAN
are the back-ends
[**ROracle**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ROracle),
[**RPostgreSQL**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RPostgreSQL) and
[**RSQLite**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RSQLite) (which works
with the bundled DBMS `SQLite`, <https://www.sqlite.org>) and
[**RJDBC**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RJDBC) (which uses Java
and can connect to any DBMS that has a JDBC driver).

**PL/R**
([`http://www.joeconway.com/plr/`](http://www.joeconway.com/plr/)) is a
project to embed R into PostgreSQL.

Package [**RMongo**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RMongo) provides
an R interface to a Java client for 'MongoDB'
(<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MongoDB>) databases, which are queried
using JavaScript rather than SQL. Package
[**mongolite**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=mongolite) is another
client using **mongodb**'s C driver.

#### 4.3.1 Packages using DBI

Package [**RMySQL**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RMySQL) on CRAN
provides an interface to the MySQL database system (see
<https://www.mysql.com> and Dubois, 2000) or its fork MariaDB (see
<https://mariadb.org/>). The description here applies to versions
`0.5-0` and later: earlier versions had a substantially different
interface. The current version requires the
[**DBI**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=DBI) package, and this
description will apply with minor changes to all the other back-ends to
[**DBI**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=DBI).

MySQL exists on Unix/Linux/macOS and Windows: there is a 'Community
Edition' released under GPL but commercial licenses are also available.
MySQL was originally a 'light and lean' database. (It preserves the case
of names where the operating file system is case-sensitive, so not on
Windows.)

The call `dbDriver("MySQL")` returns a database connection manager
object, and then a call to `dbConnect` opens a database connection which
can subsequently be closed by a call to the generic function
`dbDisconnect`. Use `dbDriver("Oracle")`, `dbDriver("PostgreSQL")` or
`dbDriver("SQLite")` with those DBMSs and packages
[**ROracle**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ROracle),
[**RPostgreSQL**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RPostgreSQL) or
[**RSQLite**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RSQLite) respectively.

SQL queries can be sent by either `dbSendQuery` or `dbGetQuery`.
`dbGetquery` sends the query and retrieves the results as a data frame.
`dbSendQuery` sends the query and returns an object of class inheriting
from `"DBIResult"` which can be used to retrieve the results, and
subsequently used in a call to `dbClearResult` to remove the result.

Function `fetch` is used to retrieve some or all of the rows in the
query result, as a list. The function `dbHasCompleted` indicates if all
the rows have been fetched, and `dbGetRowCount` returns the number of
rows in the result.

These are convenient interfaces to read/write/test/delete tables in the
database. `dbReadTable` and `dbWriteTable` copy to and from an R data
frame, mapping the row names of the data frame to the field `row_names`
in the `MySQL` table.

> library(RMySQL) # will load DBI as well

> con <- dbConnect(dbDriver("MySQL"), dbname = "test")
## list the tables in the database

#### 4.3.2 Package RODBC

Package [**RODBC**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RODBC) on CRAN
provides an interface to database sources supporting an ODBC interface.
This is very widely available, and allows the same R code to access
different database systems.
[**RODBC**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RODBC) runs on
Unix/Linux, Windows and macOS, and almost all database systems provide
support for ODBC. We have tested Microsoft SQL Server, Access, MySQL,
PostgreSQL, Oracle and IBM DB2 on Windows and MySQL, MariaDB, Oracle,
PostgreSQL and SQLite on Linux.

ODBC is a client-server system, and we have happily connected to a DBMS
running on a Unix server from a Windows client, and _vice versa_.

On Windows ODBC support is part of the OS. On Unix/Linux you will need
an ODBC Driver Manager such as unixODBC (<http://www.unixODBC.org>) or
iOBDC (<http://www.iODBC.org>: this is pre-installed in macOS) and an
installed driver for your database system.

Windows provides drivers not just for DBMSs but also for Excel
(`.xls`) spreadsheets, DBase (`.dbf`) files and even
text files. (The named applications do _not_ need to be installed. Which
file formats are supported depends on the versions of the drivers.)
There are versions for Excel and Access 2007/2010 (go to
<https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/default.aspx>, and search for
'Office ODBC', which will lead to `AccessDatabaseEngine.exe`),
the '2007 Office System Driver' (the latter has a version for 64-bit
Windows, and that will also read earlier versions).

On macOS the Actual Technologies
(<https://www.actualtech.com/product_access.php>) drivers provide ODBC
interfaces to Access databases and to Excel spreadsheets (not including
Excel 2007/2010).

Many simultaneous connections are possible. A connection is opened by a
call to `odbcConnect` or `odbcDriverConnect` (which on the Windows GUI
allows a database to be selected via dialog boxes) which returns a
handle used for subsequent access to the database. Printing a connection
will provide some details of the ODBC connection, and calling
`odbcGetInfo` will give details on the client and server.

A connection is closed by a call to `close` or `odbcClose`, and also
(with a warning) when not R object refers to it and at the end of an R
session.

Details of the tables on a connection can be found using `sqlTables`.

Function `sqlSave` copies an R data frame to a table in the database,
and `sqlFetch` copies a table in the database to an R data frame.

An SQL query can be sent to the database by a call to `sqlQuery`. This
returns the result in an R data frame. (`sqlCopy` sends a query to the
database and saves the result as a table in the database.) A finer level
of control is attained by first calling `odbcQuery` and then
`sqlGetResults` to fetch the results. The latter can be used within a
loop to retrieve a limited number of rows at a time, as can function
`sqlFetchMore`.

Here is an example using PostgreSQL, for which the ODBC driver maps
column and data frame names to lower case. We use a database `testdb` we
created earlier, and had the DSN (data source name) set up in
`~/.odbc.ini` under `unixODBC`. Exactly the same code worked
using MyODBC to access a MySQL database under Linux or Windows (where
MySQL also maps names to lowercase). Under Windows, DSNs are set up in
the ODBC applet in the Control Panel ('Data Sources (ODBC)' in the
'Administrative Tools' section).

```r
> library(RODBC)
## tell it to map names to l/case
> channel <- odbcConnect("testdb", uid="ripley", case="tolower")
## load a data frame into the database
> data(USArrests)
> sqlSave(channel, USArrests, rownames = "state", addPK = TRUE)
> rm(USArrests)
## list the tables in the database
> sqlTables(channel)
  TABLE_QUALIFIER TABLE_OWNER TABLE_NAME TABLE_TYPE REMARKS
1                              usarrests      TABLE
## list it
> sqlFetch(channel, "USArrests", rownames = "state")
               murder assault urbanpop rape
Alabama          13.2     236       58 21.2
Alaska           10.0     263       48 44.5
    ...
## an SQL query, originally on one line
> sqlQuery(channel, "select state, murder from USArrests
           where rape > 30 order by murder")
       state murder
1 Colorado      7.9
2 Arizona       8.1
3 California    9.0
4 Alaska       10.0
5 New Mexico   11.4
6 Michigan     12.1
7 Nevada       12.2
8 Florida      15.4
## remove the table
> sqlDrop(channel, "USArrests")
## close the connection
> odbcClose(channel)
```

As a simple example of using ODBC under Windows with a Excel
spreadsheet, we can read from a spreadsheet by

```r
> library(RODBC)
> channel <- odbcConnectExcel("bdr.xls")
## list the spreadsheets
> sqlTables(channel)
  TABLE_CAT TABLE_SCHEM        TABLE_NAME   TABLE_TYPE REMARKS
1 C:\\bdr            NA           Sheet1$ SYSTEM TABLE      NA
2 C:\\bdr            NA           Sheet2$ SYSTEM TABLE      NA
3 C:\\bdr            NA           Sheet3$ SYSTEM TABLE      NA
4 C:\\bdr            NA Sheet1$Print_Area        TABLE      NA
## retrieve the contents of sheet 1, by either of
> sh1 <- sqlFetch(channel, "Sheet1")
> sh1 <- sqlQuery(channel, "select * from [Sheet1$]")
```

Notice that the specification of the table is different from the name
returned by `sqlTables`: `sqlFetch` is able to map the differences.

## 5 Binary files

---

• [Binary data formats](#Binary-data-formats)     
 • [dBase files (DBF)](#dBase-files-_0028DBF_0029)

---

Binary connections ([Connections](#Connections)) are now the preferred
way to handle binary files.

---

### 5.1 Binary data formats

Packages [**h5**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=h5), Bioconductor's
**rhdf5**, [**RNetCDF**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RNetCDF) and
[**ncdf4**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ncdf4) on CRAN provide
interfaces to NASA's HDF5 (Hierarchical Data Format, see
<https://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/>) and to UCAR's netCDF data files
(network Common Data Form, see
<http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/>).

Both of these are systems to store scientific data in array-oriented
ways, including descriptions, labels, formats, units, .... HDF5 also
allows _groups_ of arrays, and the R interface maps lists to HDF5
groups, and can write numeric and character vectors and matrices.

NetCDF's version 4 format (confusingly, implemented in netCDF 4.1.1 and
later, but not in 4.0.1) includes the use of various HDF5 formats. This
is handled by package
[**ncdf4**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ncdf4) whereas
[**RNetCDF**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RNetCDF) handles
version 3 files.

The availability of software to support these formats is somewhat
limited by platform, especially on Windows.

---

### 5.2 dBase files (DBF)

`dBase` was a DOS program written by Ashton-Tate and later owned by
Borland which has a binary flat-file format that became popular, with
file extension `.dbf`. It has been adopted for the 'Xbase'
family of databases, covering dBase, Clipper, FoxPro and their Windows
equivalents Visual dBase, Visual Objects and Visual FoxPro (see
<http://www.e-bachmann.dk/docs/xbase.htm>). A dBase file contains a
header and then a series of fields and so is most similar to an R data
frame. The data itself is stored in text format, and can include
character, logical and numeric fields, and other types in later versions
(see for example
<http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/formats/fdd/fdd000325.shtml> and
<http://www.clicketyclick.dk/databases/xbase/format/index.html>).

Functions `read.dbf` and `write.dbf` provide ways to read and write
basic DBF files on all R platforms. For Windows users `odbcConnectDbase`
in package [**RODBC**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RODBC)
provides more comprehensive facilities to read DBF files _via_
Microsoft's dBase ODBC driver (and the Visual FoxPro driver can also be
used via `odbcDriverConnect`).

---

## 6 Image files

A particular class of binary files are those representing images, and a
not uncommon request is to read such a file into R as a matrix.

There are many formats for image files (most with lots of variants), and
it may be necessary to use external conversion software to first convert
the image into one of the formats for which a package currently provides
an R reader. A versatile example of such software is ImageMagick and its
fork GraphicsMagick. These provide command-line programs `convert` and
`gm convert` to convert images from one format to another: what formats
they can input is determined when they are compiled, and the supported
formats can be listed by e.g. `convert -list format`.

Package [**pixmap**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=pixmap) has a
function `read.pnm` to read 'portable anymap' images in PBM
(black/white), PGM (grey) and PPM (RGB colour) formats. These are also
known as 'netpbm' formats.

Packages [**bmp**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=bmp),
[**jpeg**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=jpeg) and
[**png**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=png) read the formats after
which they are named. See also packages
[**biOps**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=biOps) and
[**Momocs**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Momocs), and
Bioconductor package **EBImage**.

TIFF is more a meta-format, a wrapper within which a very large variety
of image formats can be embedded. Packages
[**rtiff**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rtiff) and
[**tiff**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=tiff) can read some of the
sub-formats (depending on the external `libtiff` software against which
they are compiled). There some facilities for specialized sub-formats,
for example in Bioconductor package **beadarray**.

Raster files are common in the geographical sciences, and package
[**rgdal**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rgdal) provides an
interface to GDAL which provides some facilities of its own to read
raster files and links to many others. Which formats it supports is
determined when GDAL is compiled: use `gdalDrivers()` to see what these
are for the build you are using. It can be useful for uncommon formats
such as JPEG 2000 (which is a different format from JPEG, and not
currently supported in the macOS nor Windows binary versions of
[**rgdal**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rgdal)).

## 7 Connections

_Connections_ are used in R in the sense of Chambers (1998) and Ripley
(2001), a set of functions to replace the use of file names by a
flexible interface to file-like objects.

---

• [Types of connections](#Types-of-connections)     
 • [Output to connections](#Output-to-connections)     
 • [Input from connections](#Input-from-connections)     
 • [Listing and manipulating connections](#Listing-and-manipulating-connections)     
 • [Binary connections](#Binary-connections)

---

---

### 7.1 Types of connections

The most familiar type of connection will be a file, and file
connections are created by function `file`. File connections can (if the
OS will allow it for the particular file) be opened for reading or
writing or appending, in text or binary mode. In fact, files can be
opened for both reading and writing, and R keeps a separate file
position for reading and writing.

Note that by default a connection is not opened when it is created. The
rule is that a function using a connection should open a connection
(needed) if the connection is not already open, and close a connection
after use if it opened it. In brief, leave the connection in the state
you found it in. There are generic functions `open` and `close` with
methods to explicitly open and close connections.

Files compressed via the algorithm used by `gzip` can be used as
connections created by the function `gzfile`, whereas files compressed
by `bzip2` can be used via `bzfile`.

Unix programmers are used to dealing with special files `stdin`,
`stdout` and `stderr`. These exist as _terminal connections_ in R. They
may be normal files, but they might also refer to input from and output
to a GUI console. (Even with the standard Unix R interface, `stdin`
refers to the lines submitted from `readline` rather than a file.)

The three terminal connections are always open, and cannot be opened or
closed. `stdout` and `stderr` are conventionally used for normal output
and error messages respectively. They may normally go to the same place,
but whereas normal output can be re-directed by a call to `sink`, error
output is sent to `stderr` unless re-directed by
`sink, type="message")`. Note carefully the language used here: the
connections cannot be re-directed, but output can be sent to other
connections.

_Text connections_ are another source of input. They allow R character
vectors to be read as if the lines were being read from a text file. A
text connection is created and opened by a call to `textConnection`,
which copies the current contents of the character vector to an internal
buffer at the time of creation.

Text connections can also be used to capture R output to a character
vector. `textConnection` can be asked to create a new character object
or append to an existing one, in both cases in the user's workspace. The
connection is opened by the call to `textConnection`, and at all times
the complete lines output to the connection are available in the R
object. Closing the connection writes any remaining output to a final
element of the character vector.

_Pipes_ are a special form of file that connects to another process, and
pipe connections are created by the function `pipe`. Opening a pipe
connection for writing (it makes no sense to append to a pipe) runs an
OS command, and connects its standard input to whatever R then writes to
that connection. Conversely, opening a pipe connection for input runs an
OS command and makes its standard output available for R input from that
connection.

URLs of types '`http://`', '`https://`',
'`ftp://`' and '`file://`' can be read from using the
function `url`. For convenience, `file` will also accept these as the
file specification and call `url`.

Sockets can also be used as connections via function `socketConnection`
on platforms which support Berkeley-like sockets (most Unix systems,
Linux and Windows). Sockets can be written to or read from, and both
client and server sockets can be used.

---

### 7.2 Output to connections

We have described functions `cat`, `write`, `write.table` and `sink` as
writing to a file, possibly appending to a file if argument
`append = TRUE`, and this is what they did prior to R version 1.2.0.

The current behaviour is equivalent, but what actually happens is that
when the `file` argument is a character string, a file connection is
opened (for writing or appending) and closed again at the end of the
function call. If we want to repeatedly write to the same file, it is
more efficient to explicitly declare and open the connection, and pass
the connection object to each call to an output function. This also
makes it possible to write to pipes, which was implemented earlier in a
limited way via the syntax `file = "|cmd"` (which can still be used).

There is a function `writeLines` to write complete text lines to a
connection.

Some simple examples are

```r
zz <- file("ex.data", "w")  # open an output file connection
cat("TITLE extra line", "2 3 5 7", "", "11 13 17",
    file = zz, sep = "\n")
cat("One more line\n", file = zz)
close(zz)

## convert decimal point to comma in output, using a pipe (Unix)
## both R strings and (probably) the shell need \ doubled
zz <- pipe(paste("sed s/\\\\./,/ >", "outfile"), "w")
cat(format(round(rnorm(100), 4)), sep = "\n", file = zz)
close(zz)
## now look at the output file:
file.show("outfile", delete.file = TRUE)

## capture R output: use examples from help(lm)
zz <- textConnection("ex.lm.out", "w")
sink(zz)
example(lm, prompt.echo = "> ")
sink()
close(zz)
## now ‘ex.lm.out’ contains the output for futher processing.
## Look at it by, e.g.,
cat(ex.lm.out, sep = "\n")
```

---

### 7.3 Input from connections

The basic functions to read from connections are `scan` and `readLines`.
These take a character string argument and open a file connection for
the duration of the function call, but explicitly opening a file
connection allows a file to be read sequentially in different formats.

Other functions that call `scan` can also make use of connections, in
particular `read.table`.

Some simple examples are

```r
## read in file created in last examples
readLines("ex.data")
unlink("ex.data")

## read listing of current directory (Unix)
readLines(pipe("ls -1"))

# remove trailing commas from an input file.
# Suppose we are given a file ‘data’ containing
450, 390, 467, 654,  30, 542, 334, 432, 421,
357, 497, 493, 550, 549, 467, 575, 578, 342,
446, 547, 534, 495, 979, 479
# Then read this by
scan(pipe("sed -e s/,$// data"), sep=",")
```

For convenience, if the `file` argument specifies a FTP, HTTP or HTTPS
URL, the URL is opened for reading via `url`. Specifying files via
'`file://foo.bar`' is also allowed.

---

• [Pushback](#Pushback)

---

---

#### 7.3.1 Pushback

C programmers may be familiar with the `ungetc` function to push back a
character onto a text input stream. R connections have the same idea in
a more powerful way, in that an (essentially) arbitrary number of lines
of text can be pushed back onto a connection via a call to `pushBack`.

Pushbacks operate as a stack, so a read request first uses each line
from the most recently pushbacked text, then those from earlier
pushbacks and finally reads from the connection itself. Once a
pushbacked line is read completely, it is cleared. The number of pending
lines pushed back can be found via a call to `pushBackLength`.

A simple example will show the idea.

```r
> zz <- textConnection(LETTERS)
> readLines(zz, 2)
[1] "A" "B"
> scan(zz, "", 4)
Read 4 items
[1] "C" "D" "E" "F"
> pushBack(c("aa", "bb"), zz)
> scan(zz, "", 4)
Read 4 items
[1] "aa" "bb" "G"  "H"
> close(zz)
```

Pushback is only available for connections opened for input in text
mode.

---

### 7.4 Listing and manipulating connections

A summary of all the connections currently opened by the user can be
found by `showConnections()`, and a summary of all connections,
including closed and terminal connections, by
`showConnections(all = TRUE)`

The generic function `seek` can be used to read and (on some
connections) reset the current position for reading or writing.
Unfortunately it depends on OS facilities which may be unreliable (e.g.
with text files under Windows). Function `isSeekable` reports if `seek`
can change the position on the connection given by its argument.

The function `truncate` can be used to truncate a file opened for
writing at its current position. It works only for `file` connections,
and is not implemented on all platforms.

---

### 7.5 Binary connections

Functions `readBin` and `writeBin` read to and write from binary
connections. A connection is opened in binary mode by appending `"b"` to
the mode specification, that is using mode `"rb"` for reading, and mode
`"wb"` or `"ab"` (where appropriate) for writing. The functions have
arguments

```r
readBin(con, what, n = 1, size = NA, endian = .Platform$endian)
writeBin(object, con, size = NA, endian = .Platform$endian)
```

In each case `con` is a connection which will be opened if necessary for
the duration of the call, and if a character string is given it is
assumed to specify a file name.

It is slightly simpler to describe writing, so we will do that first.
`object` should be an atomic vector object, that is a vector of mode
`numeric`, `integer`, `logical`, `character`, `complex` or `raw`,
without attributes. By default this is written to the file as a stream
of bytes exactly as it is represented in memory.

`readBin` reads a stream of bytes from the file and interprets them as a
vector of mode given by `what`. This can be either an object of the
appropriate mode (e.g. `what=integer()`) or a character string
describing the mode (one of the five given in the previous paragraph or
`"double"` or `"int"`). Argument `n` specifies the maximum number of
vector elements to read from the connection: if fewer are available a
shorter vector will be returned. Argument `signed` allows 1-byte and
2-byte integers to be read as signed (the default) or unsigned integers.

The remaining two arguments are used to write or read data for
interchange with another program or another platform. By default binary
data is transferred directly from memory to the connection or _vice
versa_. This will not suffice if the data are to be transferred to a
machine with a different architecture, but between almost all R
platforms the only change needed is that of byte-order. Common PCs
('`ix86`'-based and '`x86_64`'-based machines), Compaq
Alpha and Vaxen are _little-endian_, whereas Sun Sparc, mc680x0 series,
IBM R6000, SGI and most others are _big-endian_. (Network byte-order (as
used by XDR, eXternal Data Representation) is big-endian.) To transfer
to or from other programs we may need to do more, for example to read
16-bit integers or write single-precision real numbers. This can be done
using the `size` argument, which (usually) allows sizes 1, 2, 4, 8 for
integers and logicals, and sizes 4, 8 and perhaps 12 or 16 for reals.
Transferring at different sizes can lose precision, and should not be
attempted for vectors containing `NA`'s.

Character strings are read and written in C format, that is as a string
of bytes terminated by a zero byte. Functions `readChar` and `writeChar`
provide greater flexibility.

---

• [Special values](#Special-values)

---

---

#### 7.5.1 Special values

Functions `readBin` and `writeBin` will pass missing and special values,
although this should not be attempted if a size change is involved.

The missing value for R logical and integer types is `INT_MIN`, the
smallest representable `int` defined in the C header
`limits.h`, normally corresponding to the bit pattern
`0x80000000`.

The representation of the special values for R numeric and complex types
is machine-dependent, and possibly also compiler-dependent. The simplest
way to make use of them is to link an external application against the
standalone `Rmath` library which exports double constants `NA_REAL`,
`R_PosInf` and `R_NegInf`, and include the header `Rmath.h`
which defines the macros `ISNAN` and `R_FINITE`.

If that is not possible, on all current platforms IEC 60559 (aka IEEE

754. arithmetic is used, so standard C facilities can be used to test
     for or set `Inf`, `-Inf` and `NaN` values. On such platforms `NA` is
     represented by the `NaN` value with low-word `0x7a2` (1954 in decimal).

Character missing values are written as `NA`, and there are no provision
to recognize character values as missing (as this can be done by
re-assigning them once read).

## 8 Network interfaces

---

• [Reading from sockets](#Reading-from-sockets)     
 • [Using download.file](#Using-download_002efile)

---

Some limited facilities are available to exchange data at a lower level
across network connections.

---

### 8.1 Reading from sockets

Base R comes with some facilities to communicate _via_ BSD sockets on
systems that support them (including the common Linux, Unix and Windows
ports of R). One potential problem with using sockets is that these
facilities are often blocked for security reasons or to force the use of
Web caches, so these functions may be more useful on an intranet than
externally. For new projects it is suggested that socket connections are
used instead.

The earlier low-level interface is given by functions `make.socket`,
`read.socket`, `write.socket` and `close.socket`.

---

### 8.2 Using `download.file`

Function `download.file` is provided to read a file from a Web resource
via FTP or HTTP (including HTTPS) and write it to a file. Often this can
be avoided, as functions such as `read.table` and `scan` can read
directly from a URL, either by explicitly using `url` to open a
connection, or implicitly using it by giving a URL as the `file`
argument.

---

## 9 Reading Excel spreadsheets

The most common R data import/export question seems to be 'how do I read
an Excel spreadsheet'. This chapter collects together advice and options
given earlier. Note that most of the advice is for pre-Excel 2007
spreadsheets and not the later `.xlsx` format.

The first piece of advice is to avoid doing so if possible! If you have
access to Excel, export the data you want from Excel in tab-delimited or
comma-separated form, and use `read.delim` or `read.csv` to import it
into R. (You may need to use `read.delim2` or `read.csv2` in a locale
that uses comma as the decimal point.) Exporting a DIF file and reading
it using `read.DIF` is another possibility.

If you do not have Excel, many other programs are able to read such
spreadsheets and export in a text format on both Windows and Unix, for
example Gnumeric (<http://www.gnome.org/projects/gnumeric/>) and
OpenOffice (<https://www.openoffice.org>). You can also cut-and-paste
between the display of a spreadsheet in such a program and R:
`read.table` will read from the R console or, under Windows, from the
clipboard (via `file = "clipboard"` or `readClipboard`). The `read.DIF`
function can also read from the clipboard.

Note that an Excel `.xls` file is not just a spreadsheet: such
files can contain many sheets, and the sheets can contain formulae,
macros and so on. Not all readers can read other than the first sheet,
and may be confused by other contents of the file.

Windows users (of 32-bit R) can use `odbcConnectExcel` in package
[**RODBC**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RODBC). This can select
rows and columns from any of the sheets in an Excel spreadsheet file (at
least from Excel 97--2003, depending on your ODBC drivers: by calling
`odbcConnect` directly versions back to Excel 3.0 can be read). The
version `odbcConnectExcel2007` will read the Excel 2007 formats as well
as earlier ones (provided the drivers are installed, including with
64-bit Windows R: see [RODBC](#RODBC)). macOS users can also use
[**RODBC**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RODBC) if they have a
suitable driver (e.g. that from Actual Technologies).

`Perl` users have contributed a module `OLE::SpreadSheet::ParseExcel`
and a program `xls2csv.pl` to convert Excel 95--2003 spreadsheets to CSV
files. Package [**gdata**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=gdata)
provides a basic wrapper in its `read.xls` function. With suitable
`Perl` modules installed this function can also read Excel 2007
spreadsheets.

Packages
[**dataframes2xls**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=dataframes2xls)
and [**WriteXLS**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=WriteXLS) each
contain a function to _write_ one or more data frames to an
`.xls` file, using Python and Perl respectively.

Packages [**xlsx**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=xlsx) can read
and and manipulate Excel 2007 and later spreadsheets: it requires Java.

Package [**XLConnect**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=XLConnect)
can read, write and manipulate both Excel 97--2003 and Excel 2007/10
spreadsheets, using Java.

Package [**readxl**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=readxl) can read
both Excel 97--2003 and Excel 2007/10 spreadsheets, using an included C
library.
