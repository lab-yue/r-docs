# An Introduction to R

This is an introduction to R ("GNU S"), a language and environment for
statistical computing and graphics. R is similar to the
award-winning[^1^](#FOOT1) S system, which was developed at Bell
Laboratories by John Chambers et al. It provides a wide variety of
statistical and graphical techniques (linear and nonlinear modelling,
statistical tests, time series analysis, classification, clustering,
\...).

This manual provides information on data types, programming elements,
statistical modelling and graphics.

This manual is for R, version 3.6.3 (2020-02-29).

## Preface

This introduction to R is derived from an original set of notes
describing the S and [S-PLUS] environments written in 1990--2 by
Bill Venables and David M. Smith when at the University of Adelaide. We
have made a number of small changes to reflect differences between the R
and S programs, and expanded some of the material.

We would like to extend warm thanks to Bill Venables (and David Smith)
for granting permission to distribute this modified version of the notes
in this way, and for being a supporter of R from way back.

Comments and corrections are always welcome. Please address email
correspondence to <R-core@R-project.org>.

#### Suggestions to the reader

Most R novices will start with the introductory session in Appendix A.
This should give some familiarity with the style of R sessions and more
importantly some instant feedback on what actually happens.

Many users will come to R mainly for its graphical facilities. See
[Graphics](#Graphics), which can be read at almost any time and need not
wait until all the preceding sections have been digested.
